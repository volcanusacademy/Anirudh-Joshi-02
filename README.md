**Polymorphism**
1. Shape Polymorphism:

Create a basic hierarchy of shapes (e.g., Circle, Square, Triangle) with a common method calculateArea(). Implement polymorphism by overriding this method in each shape class and demonstrate how you can calculate the area of different shapes using polymorphism.



2. Animal Polymorphism:

Create a simple hierarchy of animals (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird) with a common method makeSound(). Implement polymorphism by overriding this method in each animal class and demonstrate how you can make different animals produce their respective sounds using polymorphism.



3. Employee Polymorphism:

Define an Employee class with a method calculateSalary(). Create subclasses for different types of employees (e.g., Full_Time_Employee, Part_Time_Employee, Intern) and demonstrate how polymorphism can be used to calculate salaries differently for each type of employee.



4. Calculator Polymorphism:

Implement a simple calculator with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use polymorphism to handle these operations in a way that allows you to perform calculations on different numeric types (e.g., integers, floats) using the same calculator class.
